# idapython-ifred

A VS Code "Cmd+P"/"Ctrl+P" like plugin written by Jinmo.

Translated to IDA Python (with AI), so no need to compile the QT & C++ code now, just copy the files to plugins directory (~/.idapro/plugins/, %APPDATA%/Hex-rays/IDA Pro/plugins/).

Easily to extend with new features (vs C++). The search performance may be slightly slower, but the impact is negligible unless you're analyzing a large codebase (>15,000 functions).

Support ida 8.x and 9.x, in progress.
